## 📖 Key Concepts

### Local AI Processing
Clara processes all AI interactions locally on your device. This means:
- No internet required for AI chat
- Complete privacy and data control
- Consistent performance regardless of internet speed
- No subscription fees or API costs

### Modular Architecture
Clara is built with extensibility in mind:
- Component-based frontend architecture
- Plugin-ready backend systems
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy customization and theming

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- Model management is basic - future versions will include advanced features
- Limited to text-based interactions (image support coming soon)
- Some model formats may require manual configuration
- Performance depends on local hardware capabilities

### Workarounds
- **Large Models**: Use smaller models for faster performance on limited hardware
- **Memory Issues**: Close other applications when running large models
- **macOS Security**: Right-click and "Open" to bypass security warnings

## 🗓️ Roadmap Preview

Future versions will include:
- **Advanced Workflow Builder** (v0.1.1)
- **Image Generation Support** (v0.1.1)
- **Plugin System** (v0.2.0)
- **Enhanced Model Management** (v0.2.0)
- **Multi-Modal Support** (v0.3.0)
