    "datasets": [{
      "label": "Sales ($)",
      "data": [12000, 15000, 18000, 22000],
      "backgroundColor": ["#3B82F6", "#10B981", "#F59E0B", "#EF4444"]
    }]
  }
}
```

### üîÑ Mermaid Diagrams

**Process Flows and Architecture:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B{Clara Analysis}
    B -->|Code| C[Generate Code]
    B -->|Data| D[Create Chart]
    B -->|Process| E[Draw Diagram]
    C --> F[Interactive Artifact]
    D --> F

Authentication,Complete,High,John
Dashboard,In Progress,Medium,Sarah
API Integration,Pending,High,Mike
Testing,Planned,Low,Team
```

## üöÄ Autonomous Mode

Clara can work independently to complete complex tasks:

### How Autonomous Mode Works

1. **Task Planning**: Clara breaks down complex requests into steps
2. **Tool Execution**: Uses available tools to complete each step
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Tracks progress and adapts to challenges
4. **Result Validation**: Verifies work quality before completion

**Example Autonomous Task:**
```
User: "Build a complete todo application with React and TypeScript"

Clara's Autonomous Process:
1. üìã Plan application structure
2. üé® Create component hierarchy
3. üíæ Implement state management
4. üéØ Add CRUD operations
5. üé® Style with Tailwind CSS
6. üß™ Add basic testing
7. ‚úÖ Validate and document
```

### Tool Integration

**Available Tools:**
- File creation and editing
- Code execution and testing
- Web research and data gathering
- Image generation and processing
- API calls and integrations

**Tool Call Example:**
```typescript
// Clara can chain multiple tools
1. create_file("components/TodoList.tsx", todoListCode)
2. create_file("hooks/useTodos.ts", customHookCode)
3. edit_file("App.tsx", integrateComponents)
4. run_command("npm test")
5. create_file("README.md", documentation)
```

## üîä Voice Integration

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)

**Natural Voice Output:**
- Multiple voice options
- Adjustable speed and pitch
- Background reading capability
- Code pronunciation optimization

**Usage:**
```typescript
// Clara reads responses aloud
User: "Explain async/await in JavaScript"
Clara: [Provides detailed explanation with voice narration]

// Configure TTS settings
Settings ‚Üí Voice ‚Üí Enable TTS
- Voice: Natural/Professional/Friendly
- Speed: 0.5x to 2.0x
- Pitch: -10 to +10
```

### Speech-to-Text (STT)

**Voice Input:**
- Hands-free interaction
- Code dictation
- Natural language commands
- Multi-language support

**Voice Commands:**
```
"Clara, create a new React component called UserProfile"
"Explain the code in the current file"
"Generate a function to sort an array of objects"
"Add error handling to this API call"
```

## üéõÔ∏è Customization

### System Prompts

**Custom Behavior:**
Clara's behavior can be customized with system prompts:

```typescript
// Professional mode
"You are a senior software engineer focused on best practices, performance, and maintainable code."

// Creative mode
"You are a creative developer who thinks outside the box and suggests innovative solutions."

// Teaching mode
"You are a patient coding instructor who explains concepts clearly with examples."
```

### Provider Configuration

```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Effective Communication

**Clear Instructions:**
```
‚úÖ Good: "Create a React component for a user profile card with name, email, avatar, and edit button"

‚ùå Vague: "Make a user component"
```

**Context Provision:**
```
‚úÖ Good: "In this React TypeScript project using Tailwind CSS, add dark mode toggle to the navigation bar"

‚ùå Limited: "Add dark mode"
```

### Task Optimization

**Breaking Down Complex Tasks:**
```typescript
// Instead of: "Build a complete e-commerce site"
// Try: 
1. "Create product listing component"
2. "Add shopping cart functionality"
3. "Implement checkout process"
4. "Add user authentication"
```

**Iterative Development:**
```typescript
// Progressive refinement
1. "Create basic todo app structure"
2. "Add styling and animations"
3. "Implement data persistence"
4. "Add advanced features"
```
