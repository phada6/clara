## 1. Introduction

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance at tasks without being explicitly programmed. Instead of relying on predefined rules, ML systems use statistical techniques to identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. The rapid growth of data generation in the digital age has made machine learning an essential tool across various industries, from healthcare and finance to entertainment and transportation.

These algorithms use statistical techniques to find patterns in data, which can then be used to make predictions or decisions. There are several types of machine learning algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and each suited to different types of problems.

Supervised learning is one of the most common types of machine learning. In this approach, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with the correct output. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs by finding the best way to transform the input data into the desired output. Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks. These algorithms are used in a wide range of applications such as image recognition, speech recognition, and predictive analytics.

Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves training an algorithm on an unlabeled dataset, meaning that",421.3218688964844,201,6.31623387336731,31.82276084606774,True,,0,0
